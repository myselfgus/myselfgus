## 🧠 What I Build

**Voither Healthcare OS** — Private edge cloud for B2G healthcare operations (SUS/Brazil)

Core architecture:
- **4 specialized fine-tuned LLMs** running locally on Apple Silicon (M3/M4 Ultra)
- **Mestral Engine**: RMS (memory) + RRE (reasoning) + ROE (orchestration) + Mestral (cross-domain semantics)
- **Edge-first deployment**: Mac Studio mini-datacenters + Starlink connectivity
- **Sortio**: Intelligent bed regulation and patient flow orchestration

```
STT → RRE → RMS → Mestral → ROE → {EHR automation, clinical follow-up, network orchestration}
```

**Key differentiators:**
- PHI never leaves the edge (HIPAA/LGPD/GDPR by design)
- 85% cost reduction vs traditional cloud-heavy healthcare IT

## 💡 About Me

**M.D. (Psychiatry) + Public Administration → AI Systems Architect**

**ASD 2e** (autism spectrum, twice exceptional) — Learned systems architecture through LLM prompting.

I architect complex systems by conversing with AI, then translate those architectures into production infrastructure. Meta-recursive approach: used LLMs to learn how to build systems OF specialized LLMs.

### Background

**Clinical & Public Health:**
- **M.D., Psychiatry** — Clinical practice with focus on narrative medicine and patient trajectories
- **B.Sc., Public Administration** — Policy, health systems, and government operations
- **UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund)** — Intern at embassy, reproductive health policy
- **WHO/PAHO Director's Council Regional Meeting** — Washington DC, 2018

**Tech Transition:**
Clinical expertise → Public health operations → AI-native healthcare infrastructure

This unique path (clinician → policymaker → tech architect) informs Voither's design:
- **Clinical intuition** embedded in RRE reasoning
- **Health systems knowledge** drives Sortio's workflow logic
- **Policy compliance** built into edge architecture (HIPAA/LGPD)

**Recognition:**
- Selected for MongoDB for Startups **AI Track** (exclusive)
- Google Cloud for Startups **Start Tier** approved
- Cloudflare for Startups **approved**
