## 🧠 What I Build

**Voither Healthcare OS** — Private edge cloud for B2G healthcare operations (SUS/Brazil)

Core architecture:
- **4 specialized fine-tuned LLMs** running locally on Apple Silicon (M3/M4 Ultra)
- **Mestral Engine**: RMS (memory) + RRE (reasoning) + ROE (orchestration) + Mestral (cross-domain semantics)
- **Edge-first deployment**: Mac Studio mini-datacenters + Starlink connectivity
- **Sortio**: Intelligent bed regulation and patient flow orchestration

```
STT → RRE → RMS → Mestral → ROE → {EHR automation, clinical follow-up, network orchestration}
```

**Key differentiators:**
- PHI never leaves the edge (HIPAA/LGPD/GDPR by design)
- 85% cost reduction vs traditional cloud-heavy healthcare IT

## 🎯 Current Focus (18-month roadmap)

- [x] Architecture validated by MongoDB, Google Cloud, Cloudflare for Startups
- [x] Mestral Engine core components (RMS/RRE/ROE)
- [ ] Fine-tuning specialized LLMs (Llama 3 base → domain-specific)
- [ ] **Pilot deployment: Rio Preto (SUS)**
- [ ] Clinical validation (IRB-approved trial)
- [ ] Scale to regional health networks

## 💡 About Me

**TEA 2e** (Twice Exceptional) — Learned systems architecture through LLM prompting.

I architect complex systems by conversing with AI, then translate those architectures into production infrastructure. Meta-recursive approach: used LLMs to learn how to build systems OF specialized LLMs.

**Recognition:**
- Selected for MongoDB for Startups **AI Track** (exclusive)
- Google Cloud for Startups **Start Tier** approved
- Cloudflare for Startups
