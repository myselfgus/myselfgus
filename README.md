## Key Projects

### MedScribe
Automated detection system for antipsychotic-induced cognitive impairment using computational linguistics.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Validated on 400+ clinical cases**
- **Processing pipeline:** ~200 hours of psychiatric consultation audio (40-80GB)
- **Speech-to-Text:** ElevenLabs integration
- **Clinical Analysis:** Advanced Semantic Linguistics (ASL v2.0)
- **Dimensional Framework:** 15 mental health dimensions mapped to:
  - RDoC (Research Domain Criteria)
  - HiTOP (Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology)
  - Big Five Personality Traits
  - WHODAS 2.0 (Disability Assessment Schedule)
- **Output:** Comprehensive clinical alerts and evidence-based recommendations

### Sortio
Patient-facing therapeutic companion application with conversational AI and gamification elements for sustained engagement.

### Espa√ßo Mental ‚Ñ≥
15-dimensional geometric architecture for mapping mental states using NLP and prosodic analysis. Framework developed from phenomenological direct experience, formalized mathematically, and validated through AI-generated visualizations.

## Platform Architecture (Voither)

**Design Principles:**
- Edge-first processing
- Data sovereignty: patient data stays "with the patient"

I value direct technical communication and production-ready implementations. All code and architectures shared are designed for production deployment, never placeholders or simplified versions.
